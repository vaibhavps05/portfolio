    title: "Book Recommendation System",
    description:
      "This project involves developing a book recommendation system that uses the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm and collaborative filtering. By analyzing clickstream data and using Euclidean distance, the system generates fast and personalized book recommendations. The model powers a website where users receive relevant book suggestions based on their search queries, demonstrating the system's ability to improve the book discovery process through precise and personalized recommendations.",

    description:
      "Developed a model to classify news as REAL or FAKE using TfidfVectorizer, which converts text into numeric form while emphasizing key terms. The model was trained with a Passive Aggressive Classifier on this vectorized data, enabling it to detect patterns distinguishing real news from fake news. The performance of the model was evaluated, achieving an accuracy rate of 92.82%, and was supported by a thorough analysis using a confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness.",
